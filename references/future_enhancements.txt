Why 59 Strategies Instead of 151
The "151 Trading Strategies" paper by Kakushadze and Serur covers strategies across many asset classes, most of which require data not available from Hyperliquid's OHLCV API:

Asset Classes in the Paper (with approximate strategy counts)
Section	Asset Class	Strategies	Data Requirements
2	Options	~56	Strike prices, expirations, Greeks, option chains
3	Stocks	~21	Earnings data, fundamentals, multiple stocks for pairs
4	ETFs	~8	Sector data, multiple ETF prices, benchmark data
5	Fixed Income	~15	Bond yields, duration, convexity, swap rates
6	Indexes	~6	Index composition, dispersion data, ETF NAVs
7	Volatility	~8	VIX futures, variance swaps, implied volatility surfaces
8	Foreign Exchange	~6	Interest rate differentials, carry data
9	Commodities	~6	Roll yields, hedging pressure, inventory data
10	Futures	~7	Calendar spreads, cross-hedging data
11+	Others	~18+	Convertibles, real estate, tax arbitrage, etc.

What Hyperliquid Provides
Only: OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for single assets
No: Options chains, fundamentals, earnings, multi-asset correlations, yield curves, etc.

What Was Implemented (59 strategies)
The 59 implemented strategies are technical analysis strategies that can be calculated purely from OHLCV data:

Category	Count	Examples
Trend Following	8	SMA, EMA Cross, MACD, Parabolic SAR
Mean Reversion	5	Bollinger, Stochastic, RSI
Momentum	6	ROC, ADX, CMF
Volatility	5	ATR, Keltner Channel
Support/Resistance	5	Pivot Points, Fibonacci, Ichimoku
Options-Adapted	20	Simplified versions with warnings
Multi-Factor	10	Combined indicators

The Gap
The remaining ~92 strategies in the paper require:

Options data (56 strategies) - strike prices, expirations, Greeks
Fundamental data - earnings, P/E ratios, book values
Multi-asset data - pairs trading, statistical arbitrage, sector rotation
Fixed income data - yield curves, bond durations, swap rates
External feeds - VIX, interest rates, economic indicators

These are structurally impossible to implement with only single-asset OHLCV data from Hyperliquid.
